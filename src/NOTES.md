Marketing has always been hard, and in 2025 it's still hard. 
Whether your brand is still focusing on mass advertising, if you have shifted to UGC and creator marketing, or if you're somewhere in between, it's easy to spend a lot of money and not be confident of ROI.
Agencies were once the gold standard, but today they are too slow, too expensive, and their business model and processes are not suited for an era where creator/content marketing and user generated content are rapidly dominating marketing budgets.
Job boards claim to accelerate creative projects, but staffing is only one of the hard parts of successfully executing a marketing push in a 21st century way.
Even with AI-enhanced search, job boards do not solve enough of the problem to really accelerate a creative content creation because are just a tool, not a hub.
